A vulnerability assessment report for Artemis Financial

-Briefly summarize your client, Artemis Financial, and their software requirements. Who was the client? What issue did they want you to address?
    Artmeis Financial is a a consulting company that develops individualized financial plans for their customers. The financial plans include savings, retirement, investments, and insurance. Artmeis Financial has a web application that runs on a RESTful API and were seeking advice on how best to solve their increasing security concerns. They needed a vulnerability assessment run on their outdated infrastructure as well as various encryption and key certification needs. 
-What did you do very well when you found your client’s software security vulnerabilities? Why is it important to code securely? What value does software security add to a company’s overall wellbeing?
  Assessing the fixes for the vulnerabilites inherent in their application was a large priority and is handled in depth in the attached report. Either updates to the dependencies or potential in house fixes are addressed in length so that each vulnerability can be addressed fully, creating a secure RESTful API. Coding securely from the start to the end of a project saves the company money, time, and reputation in the long run. While up font costs are more expensive, the cost is worth avoiding data breach, outage of services, and a bad reputation for safe handling of customer data. An unsecure software harms a companies overall wellbeing in a number of ways. These include, but are not limited to, DOS attacks that will prevent an application from running at all, breaches of customer data and the ensuing reporting/financial implications, collection of employee data that can be used to compromise individuals as well as the company at large, and the companies proprietary data. All of this can be avoided, for the most part, with secure software practices throughout development.
-What part of the vulnerability assessment was challenging or helpful to you?
  The raw count of vulnerabilities was overwhelming intiaially. Over 100 vulnerabilities were found. While many of them were false positives, a majority required research to find updated dependencies or in-house work arounds to solve.
-How did you increase layers of security? In the future, what would you use to assess vulnerabilities and decide which mitigation techniques to use?
  I would increase layers of security further by adding in input validation/whitelisting/blacklisting for any avalible user input, hasing and salting passwords across the board would be implimented, html code would be refactored to avoid html injection, any file transfers or API connections would be encrypted and key certified to ensure security, and best industry standard coding practices would be utilized for secure quality code.
-How did you make certain the code and software application were functional and secure? After refactoring the code, how did you check to see whether you introduced new vulnerabilities?
  Code was tested statically using maven dependecy checks and test cases for refactored code. The rafactoring was an encryption cypher that protected messages sent over a network with a key certificate attached to ensure the message had not been compomised or seen in its transit. The tests ensured that the encryption resulted in a secure webpage and the key was tested for functionality. Vulnerability assessment reports were manufactured and worked through to provide solutions to issues that had not beed addressed yet and would be re-tested after all issues were mitigated or software updated. 
-What resources, tools, or coding practices did you use that might be helpful in future assignments or tasks?
  Maven dependency checks were essential in finding the vulnerabilities in the RESTful API and should be utilized again. or another similar software, should the time come to assess dependency vulnerabilities. Using Javas built in key-tool was also very helpful in ensuring a secure application along with SHA-256 encryption cyphers. I would utilize all of these in the future due to their ease of use and ability to protect data and the software at large.
-Employers sometimes ask for examples of work that you have successfully completed to show your skills, knowledge, and experience. What might you show future employers from this assignment?
  I would show my employers the suggested fixes for the large count of vulnerabilities, which is quite a robust list of fixes.
